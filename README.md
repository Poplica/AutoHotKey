## Why is this useful?

These scripts have helped me a lot for input-intensive/specific tasks, and they have served for a variety of purposes: botting for resources, autoclicking, and macros.

## How to use these scripts?

Make sure that [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is installed and download the repo. Most files are already saved as AHK, so you only need to double click on the scripts to activate them. Likewise, activated scripts will rebind keys to their respective functions.

## Languages/Libraries used
